# the_archlife
I plan to make the Archlife a user generated database of spotted wildlife.
A user may post the GPS coordinate of a spotted specimen that includes the species, photo, time and date of the recording.
The GPS coordinate can be mapped onto a interactive map such as google maps.

The homepage should just be the map with the last 20 posted specimens that anyone can see or a list of activity link to the location on the map.
Users can log in or sign up depending on their status.
